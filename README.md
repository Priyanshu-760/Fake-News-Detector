🚀 Project Title & Tagline
==========================
**Fake News Detector** 📰
**"Empowering Critical Thinking in the Age of Misinformation"** 💡

📖 Description
---------------
The Fake News Detector project is a web-based application designed to help users identify potentially misleading or false information in online news articles. With the rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. Our project aims to provide a simple, user-friendly tool that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze the text of news articles and predict the likelihood of them being fake.

The project utilizes a combination of techniques, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, to build a robust model that can detect fake news with high accuracy. The web application allows users to input the text of a news article, and our backend API will return a prediction, along with a confidence score, indicating the likelihood of the article being fake. Our goal is to provide a valuable resource for journalists, researchers, and the general public to help combat the spread of misinformation.

The Fake News Detector project is built using a microservices architecture, with a Flask backend API, a JavaScript frontend, and a CSS stylesheet for styling. The project also utilizes several libraries and frameworks, including NLTK, scikit-learn, and Tailwind CSS. We believe that our project has the potential to make a significant impact in the fight against misinformation and promote critical thinking in the digital age.

✨ Features
--------
The following are some of the key features of the Fake News Detector project:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Our project utilizes techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to preprocess the text of news articles and extract relevant features.
2. **Feature Extraction**: We use techniques such as TF-IDF to extract features from the preprocessed text, which are then used to train our machine learning model.
3. **Classification**: Our project uses a supervised learning approach to train a classifier that can predict the likelihood of a news article being fake.
4. **Web Application**: Our project includes a user-friendly web application that allows users to input the text of a news article and receive a prediction, along with a confidence score.
5. **Backend API**: Our project includes a Flask backend API that handles requests from the frontend and returns predictions, along with confidence scores.
6. **Frontend**: Our project includes a JavaScript frontend that handles user input, sends requests to the backend API, and displays the results.
7. **Styling**: Our project includes a CSS stylesheet that provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
8. **Model Training**: Our project includes a script that trains our machine learning model using a dataset of labeled news articles.
